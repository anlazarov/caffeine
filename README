ABOUT:
Caffeine is an experimental extension for Google ChromeBooks that overrides the default power settings. Source code available here: https://github.com/triune/caffeine

CHANGES:
v1 offers a simple icon that you can toggle to keep the screen on or off (the default mode is off and uses the ChromeBook's default power settings).
v2 was a complete re-write using Chrome's new event model vs. the older background page model. This update also got rid of the older deprecated v1 manifest and added an on-install notification to inform the user that the extension is now running.

INSTALL:
1) Go to about:flags on your ChromeBook, enable "Experimental Extension APIs", restart.
2) Go to extensions, toggle on Developer Mode, and click load unpacked extension. 
3) Choose the folder containing this source.
4) Toggle / unToggle the menu icon to keep Chrome awake!
